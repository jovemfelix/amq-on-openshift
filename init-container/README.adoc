= Init container

The AMQ Pod consist of two containers:

* Init container
+
This init container runs an `artemis create ...` command - and additional scripts - to generate an AMQ configuration based on the parameters set in CRs. This config is recreated - not persisted - every time the Pod starts, that's how changes in the CRs are being applied. 
* Broker container
+
The main container runs `artemis run ...` with the config generated by the init container (at `/home/jboss/amq-broker`) using the `data` directories from the persistent volume (`/opt/my-broker/data`).

For the container startup scripts see https://github.com/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker-kubernetes-image/blob/main/modules/activemq-artemis-launch/added/launch.sh[launch.sh] in the _AMQ Broker Container Image Source Code_ downloads for the release being used.

== Custom init container

The operator supports the most common use cases, but we can't set all the parameters for the broker, we need a custom init container for advanced configuration. The source for a custom init container is simple:

----
.
├── Dockerfile
└── post-config.sh
----

* *Dockerfile*: Make sure you build FROM the original init container matching your AMQ version.
+
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/amq7/amq-broker-init-rhel8:7.10-28
ADD ./post-config.sh /amq/scripts/post-config.sh
---- 
* *post-config.sh*: This script is called after the `artemis create` command. We can modify the generated configuration in `$CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR` directory.

The built init container then must be added to the _ActiveMQArtemis_ CR:

----
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    initImage: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/myproject/my-amq-init:latest
----

Regular rebuild of the custom init container is recommended as new versions of the init container is released (~4-6 weeks).

== How to use init container

The AMQ config files generated by the init container will be available at `$CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR` location in the _post-config.sh_. We can use the basic Linux tool (sed, awk...) to edit these files or add additional files to the directory structure. Generally it's recommended to modify small sections or append to generated config files instead for overwriting them, to avoid any issues when a new operator version may introduce changes in these files.

=== Edit generated files

Edit a _broker.xml_ line with _sed_ for example:

----
sed -i 's|<critical-analyzer>.*<\/critical-analyzer>|<critical-analyzer>false</critical-analyzer>|' ${CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR}/etc/broker.xml
----

Multiline edit is possible like:

----
sed -i ':a;N;$!ba s|<security-settings>|<security-invalidation-interval>'$SECURITY_INVALIDATION_INTERVAL'</security-invalidation-interval>\n      <security-settings>|' ${CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR}/etc/broker.xml
----

Appending to a file:

----
echo >>${CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR}/etc/artemis.profile #new line
echo 'JAVA_ARGS="$JAVA_ARGS -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50"' >>${CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR}/etc/artemis.profile
----

=== Overwrite or add files

ConfigMaps and Secrets can be mounted to init and broker container in the _ActiveMQArtemis_ CR (these _ConfigMaps_/_Secrets_ must exist if they are listed):

----
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    extraMounts:
      configMaps:
        - broker-add-vars
        - broker-add-files
      secrets:
        - broker-add-vars-secret
        - broker-add-files-secret
----

The entries are available as files in the containers at a fixed mount point, for example: `/amq/extra/configmaps/broker-add-files/cert-users.properties`. They can be copied - or linked to utilize AMQ's config reload feature - to the `$CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR` directory to add new files or overwrite the generated ones.

----
ln -fvs /amq/extra/configmaps/broker-add-files/cert-users.properties $CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR/etc/
----

=== Env variables

The _post-config.sh_ script is added to the init container image itself, which is used in different environments. At this point it's not possible to add custom environment variables with the operator - but hopefully https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ENTMQBR-5203[soon] - so the script can't set environment specific values. One workaround is to read parameters from an `extraMounts` mounted _ConfigMap_ (or _Secret_) at the beginning of the _post-config.sh_ like this:

----
for config_file in /amq/extra/configmaps/broker-env-vars/*;
do
    echo "Source env variables from $config_file"
    source $config_file
done
----

Let's assume the `broker-env-vars` _ConfigMap_ has an entry `envvars` like below. These variables - coming from a ConfigMap - can be used in the rest of the script now.

----
SECURITY_INVALIDATION_INTERVAL=60000
LOG_ROTATION_SIZE=100000000
LOG_ROTATION_COUNT=3
----

If the _ConfigMap_ entries are also added to artemis.profile (`echo "source $config_file" >>${CONFIG_INSTANCE_DIR}/etc/artemis.profile`), we can directly set or modify environment variables for the Artemis process running in the broker container, configurable per environment:

----
JAVA_ARGS="$JAVA_ARGS -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=${ARTEMIS_OOME_DUMP}"
DEBUG_ARGS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"
----
